# gwish-outreach
Notebooks to use as workshops during outreach with Graduate Women in Science HawaiÊ»i.

The exoplanet workshop leads students through the discovery of an exoplanet using data from the Kepler Space Telescope. 

The lunar workshop leads students through the process of aging areas of the moon by counting craters.

Linnea: craterpy requires numpy >= 2.2.3, but lightkruev requires numpy >= 1.23.0. I'm not sure how to resolve this. Maybe I need two environments- one for lunar workshop and one for the exoplanet workshop? TODO!
