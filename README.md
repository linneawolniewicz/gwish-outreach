# gwish-outreach
Notebooks to use as workshops during outreach with Graduate Women in Science Hawai ªi.

The exoplanet workshop leads students through the discovery of an exoplanet using data from the Kepler Space Telescope. 

The lunar workshop leads students through the process of aging areas of the moon by counting craters.

Note: there are two requirements.txt files, one for the exoplanet workshop and one for the lunar workshop. To launch a workshop through binder, rename the one of interest to "requirements.txt" before launching the binder.
