# gwish-outreach
Notebooks to use as workshops during outreach with Graduate Women in Science Hawai ªi.

The exoplanet workshop leads students through the discovery of an exoplanet using data from the Kepler Space Telescope. 

The lunar workshop leads students through the process of aging areas of the moon by counting craters.

## Usage
To use the exoplanet workshop, go to the exoplanet branch and launch the binder link in that README.

To use the lunar workshop, go to the Lunar branch and launch the binder link in that README.

This is because of conflicting dependencies for each workshop environment.
